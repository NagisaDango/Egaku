Egaku is a two-player cooperative platformer game where teamwork is key. One player takes on the role of the "Runner" controlling a character to navigate and reach the goal, while the other player acts as the "Drawer" drawing platforms on the screen to help the Runner overcome obstacles and progress through the level.

Victory Condition

The game is won when the Runner successfully reaches the goal.
Player 1: The Runner

As the Runner, your objective is to guide the character to the endpoint using various movement controls.
Controls: Controls: Move left and right (Arrow Keys or WASD) / Jump (Space) / Interact (E)
Player 2: The Drawer

The Drawer assists the Runner by drawing platforms that appear in the game world. You can customize your drawing tools for better control.
